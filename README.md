Monitoring BI Dashboard


This is a BI information system to organize an online store’s transactions based on data provided by a Shopify store. Naming the project "SoCharme" is due to the name of the Shopify store for which we have created this system. This BI system integrates all the data from different sources to take relevant decisions and help the company with the monitoring of the current, previous as well as the future state of activity of sales and all other transactions.
The used data are collected from Facebook Ads Manager (Pixels) that take care of all details about Facebook ads which promote the store products as well as new offers. The data are also taken from Shopify which is a commercial platform that sums up all store transactions and sales as long as clients’ pieces of information. It contains also all product’s descriptions and details including ReCharge payment which is a specific application in Shopify that takes care of subscriptions. Through the dashboards, the company will be able to supervise the performance of its different activities. For that, I have familiarized with the Power BI tool, which will be the basis of my project.
